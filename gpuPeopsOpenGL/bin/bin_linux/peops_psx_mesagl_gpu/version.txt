01.04.2009 Version 1.78

- the plugin is now Open Source (GPL), check out www.pbernert.com

10.11.2003 Version 1.75

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- additional notes:

  This plugin is compiled on a newer Linux version than the previous plugins.
  Well, my Suse8.0 based system is getting older (gcc 2.95.3, for example),
  but I still don't feel the urge to update it (rock stable, everything works
  exactly as I want it to... I tend not to fix anything which isn't broken).

  But I also want to see if the the infamous nVidia pthread segmentation fault
  occuring on some distros will go away with newer stuff, so I did an easy trick:
  I booted up a Knoppix 3.3 CD, and compiled the plugins with this new Debian
  based distro (gcc 3.2.3, for example).

  At least the plugin file size did shrink with the newer compiler, we will see
  if you notice any speed ups, or even if the seg fault is now fixed completely
  without any tricks and hacks. Btw, I can run the new plugin just fine on my old
  Linux system.

  Ah, some final note: the Knoppix distro didn't have a MesaGL lib file, so I
  linked the plugin with the GL library instead. Both libs are the same on
  most distros (MesaGL is just a link to GL, or vice versa), but if you don't
  have a libGL available the plugin will not start up. In this case just create
  a link to your Mesa library, and everything will work as it should.

----------------------------------
01.08.2003 Version 1.73

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- additional notes:

  * Takashi Yano suggested to link the plugin to the pthread library (even if
    I don't use it at all), to get around the nVidia segmentation fault that
    is happening on some RedHat/Mandrake distros. Well, I have done that, we
    will see if it helps :)

  * I am using an ATI 9700 Pro now (instead of my old GF3). ATI's FireGL driver
    is working fine with this plugin, only the Framebuffer Texture option (used
    by special effects like the FF9 battle swirl) seems to produce errors. Well,
    if you encountering the same probs with your ATI card, simply use mode 3 of
    the "Framebuffer textures" option, instead of mode 2, that will do the trick.
    Also check out the new special game fix 0x40 (Soft FB access), that one can
    speed up certain effects as well (if you are having a fast cpu).

19.04.2003 Version 1.71

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- additional notes:

  * the full version info, FAQ and readme files can be found in the Windows
    gpu plugin archive.

  * Some users reported that RedHat 9 + nVidia drivers are having troubles with
    my Mesa plugin. Other users reported that RedHat 9 + nVidia drivers are running
    fine with my Mesa plugin. Since I don't use RedHat, I cannot say anything about
    it. So maybe you should post your problems in an emu forum like the ones on
    www.ngemu.com. With luck, some other RH user may be able to help you.

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- oh, and another way to fix the Red Hat/Mandrake pthread
  problem (thanx to Hez Carty):

1. Install/unzip/untar epsxe and plugins
2. Copy libpthread-0.9.so from /lib to the epsxe dir
3. Type 'ln -s libpthread-0.9.so libpthread.so.0' to make a link to the library
4. Type 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD' so that the program looks here for the offending library
5. Run epsxe and enjoy!

23.06.2002 Version 1.63

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- oh, and for users having troubles to run the mesagl (using a nVidia
  card) and the oss sound plugin together (usually on some RedHat/
  Mandrake distros), try:

  ln -sf /lib/libpthread-0.9.so /lib/i686/libpthread.so.0

  Thanx to CAB for the infos (more about it in the readme file) :)

----------------------------------
28.04.2002 Version 1.61

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- I've upgraded to Suse 8.0, so I am using newer libraries as
  with the older plugin versions.
  It's working flawless here (and I have to admit I like the
  new Suse distribution very much), so I hope no new problems
  arise with other distributions as well... we will see :)

23.03.2002 Version 1.59

- same improvements as the Windows plugins


----------------------------------
16.02.2002 Version 1.58

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- fixed a small bug which caused the plugin not to read the settings,
  if the cfg files were located in the main epsxe directory

- about the crashes with some systems, if the OSS sound plugin
  is used together with the MesaGL one: well, in the nVidia linux
  kernel readme is stated, that the nvidia glx will crash, if an
  application is using the pthread library, due to a buggy library
  loader. My OSS sound plugin IS using the pthread library, so
  prolly that's the cause of the troubles. Well, with epsxe and
  the new pcsx emu the sound plugin can also work without threads
  (using the spuupdate func), so prolly my next spu release will
  offer a thread spu, and a non-thread spu... we will see if that
  does work.


----------------------------------
04.02.2002 Version 1.57

- same improvements as the Windows plugins

- libXxf86vm.so isn't needed anymore, I now link statically to the
  vm funcs, seems to be working fine on all systems. Therefore:
  only one plugin in the archive this time, not a vm and non-vm one :)

- if you have troubles configuring epsxe 1.5.0 and/or this gpu plugin,
  keep the following in mind:
  putting the cfg* and *.cfg files into the special epsxe "cfg"
  directory should solve all plugin config troubles (don't forget to
  remove the cfg files from all other locations).
  Starting epsxe from the main epsxe directory (doing "./epsxe")
  should solve all other config issues (like not visible plugins,
  not saved epsxe settings, etc). Thats' all (oh, btw, some linux
  psx plugins may not work with epsxe, like the peops SDL plugin
  version... try to clean up your epsxe plugins directory, if you
  are having any more troubles selecting/configuring plugins).

- a stupid and strange bug: some systems (red hat ones? mmm...)
  can't run the mesa plugin and the oss sound plugin together...
  soft + oss works, mesa + oss are causing seg faults/lock ups when
  you try to start a game.
  Only solution right now: start the emu, go to the gpu plugin
  selection window, close that window again, and now start the
  game... all will be working fine.
  Of course you have to do that every time when you are starting
  the emu again.
  I have _NO_ clue what is causing that (some rh libraries? some
  kernel bug? nvidia drivers?), but I know how to 'fix' it in
  the main emu: instead of doing a
   "dlopen(gpuplugin);...run the game..."
  the main emu coder has to do:
   "dlopen(gpuplugin);dlclose();dlopen(gpuplugin);...run..."
  Great, isn't it? ;(

----------------------------------
06.01.2002 Version 1.56b

- it seems that some distros/XF86 versions doesn't have a
  xf86vm library, which I used for changing the video
  mode in V1.56
  Therefore I have compiled a version without that functionality
  (bah!), you can find that version in the subdirectory
  "noXF86vm"

----------------------------------
05.01.2002 Version 1.56

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.56...
- fixed an configure/about window issue on some systems, both
  windows should now appear without problems
- finally I did a function for changing the video mode, if you
  want to use the plugin in fullscreen. Still your XServer has
  to support the wanted video mode, otherwise the resolution
  will not change!

----------------------------------
02.12.2001 Version 1.55

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.55...
- finally a configure and about window, if the main emu has
  a gui to select and configure the plugins.

----------------------------------
04.11.2001 Version 1.54

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.54...

----------------------------------
01.09.2001 Version 1.52

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.52...
  well, not exactly... as a matter of fact the MesaGL plugin is more
  advanced :)
  I've fixed some issues when using 'gfx card framebuffer textures', now
  special blurred screens are not shaking anymore (for example Chrono
  Cross, Alone in the Dark4, Alundra2...)
  That function will be fixed in the V1.53 Windows plugins as well,
  of course, but right now my MesaGL plugin is doing a better job :)

- most new features (save state picture funcs, keep aspect ratio,
  scanline blending, real subtractive blending) are implemented,
  only a few things are (still) missing:
  * gpu configure window (you have to use a text editor right now)
  * real fullscreen mode (the kde task bar/panel is still on top, pfff)

- the timer func for calculating the frame rate uses now an higher
  resolution, that's making the fps limitation somewhat smoother

----------------------------------
28.04.2001 Version 1.49

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.49...

----------------------------------
07.04.2001 Version 1.48

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.48...
  also done: added the "MaskDetect=..." in the sample config
  file (I've forgotten to add it in the previous versions)

----------------------------------
23.02.2001 Version 1.46

- just a small change: you can activate the old PC FPS calculation
  by setting the "special game fix" bit... it will help to get the
  right speed with some games (it kinda fixes the screwed main emu vsync)

----------------------------------
11.02.2001 Version 1.45

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.45

----------------------------------
29.10.2000 Version 1.39

- same features and fixes as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.39
- V1.39 doesn't use the OpenGL texture matrix anymore, because
  some MesaGL versions are buggy with that feature :(
- new linking with math library, so I hope those silly error
  messages on some systems will disappear. I still DON'T link
  with the svga lib, though. The main app can do that, if it
  want to support svga lib dependend MesaGL.

----------------------------------
15.10.2000 Version 1.38

- first release
- same features as my Windows OpenGL plugin V1.38

----------------------------------
